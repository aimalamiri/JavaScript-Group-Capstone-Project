# Meal Time restaurante website

> The Meal Time website is our JavaScript capstone project. It is about building our own web application based on two external API. We selected the [Free Meal API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) by [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) that provides data for meals to build the webapp around it. We also used the [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) to record _likes_ and _comments_.

The webapp has two user interfaces, since we were a team of two:

- A home page showing a list of items that you can "like."
- A popup window with more data about an item that you can use to comment on.

In the future, we could add another interface to create reservations for a table at the restaurant.

You may read [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-javascript/blob/main/group-capstone/js_capstone.md) the document with all the requirements for the project document.
